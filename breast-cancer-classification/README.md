This section is purely used in building up the model. The built model is used in the App file directly as 'my_model.h5' file
How to run it?
1. Download dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images) and extract it into the same directory as your "breast-cancer-classification" folder
2. Run the 'build_dataset.py' to distribute the images into 3 sets namely Training, Testing and Validation
3. Run the 'train_model.py'. This starts training the model and saves it in a '.h5' file.
4. Copy the '.h5' file in the "App" folder
